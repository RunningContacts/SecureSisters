**Snyk Malicious Package Finder**

**Description:**
Malicious package finder used Snyk CLI results to scan for malicious packages. It provides an extra layer of protection and helps ensure that your project is free from potential vulnerabilities.
This .yml file will parse through your snyk CLI output file (json)
Then review the results for where snyk has identified a Malicious Package.  
The results can be consumed by a flat file and break the build process.

**Getting Started**

**Setup**
[ Include step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project locally. This may include cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and any other required configurations. ]

**Usage**
To use this workflow in your Node.js repository, follow these steps:

Copy the contents of the main.yml file to a new YAML file named .github/workflows/security.yml in your repository.

Ensure you have set up the required secrets, including SNYK_TOKEN, in your repository settings to enable secure access to Snyk.

Commit and push the changes to your repository.

**Features**
Integration with Snyk CLI to fetch and analyze security data.
Scan for malicious packages in your Open Sourceprojects.
Generate a detailed report of vulnerabilities found.
Easy-to-use and seamless integration with your existing development workflow.

**Workflow Deccription**
The workflow is triggered on every push to the repository. It runs a security job named security on an ubuntu-latest runner. The job consists of several steps to scan for vulnerabilities and identify malicious packages:

The workflow starts by checking out the repository code using the actions/checkout@master action.

Next, the Snyk CLI is used to check for vulnerabilities in the Node.js project. The snyk/actions/node@master action is utilized to perform this task. The scan continues even if errors are encountered using continue-on-error: true. The environment variable SNYK_TOKEN is set using a secret, allowing secure access to Snyk.

After the scan is completed, the workflow counts the number of resulting vulnerabilities, specifically those marked as malicious. The data is extracted from the results.json file generated by Snyk CLI. The count is stored in an environment variable VULNS using the jq command.

The workflow then outputs the results to a text file named malicious_vulnerabilities.txt. It extracts the details of vulnerabilities flagged as malicious from results.json using jq and writes them to the text file.

The workflow proceeds to print the contents of malicious_vulnerabilities.txt, displaying the details of any malicious vulnerabilities found.

Finally, the workflow checks the environment variable VULNS to see if any malicious vulnerabilities were detected. If VULNS is greater than 0, it fails the job using exit 1, indicating that malicious vulnerabilities were found.
